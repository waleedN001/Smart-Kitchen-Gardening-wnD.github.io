                        <p className="text-muted">A hand trowel is a small tool that is essential for planting, transplanting and potting. Look for one with a sturdy connection between blade and handle, and a comfortable grip on the handle to avoid hand fatigue and give you optimal control. A hand trowel is a gardening tool which is designed for digging small holes, transplanting seedlings, planting bulbs, and performing similar tasks. Many gardeners find hand trowels immensely useful, and they are quite common in gardening sheds as a result. Any garden supply store will sell hand trowels, along with other handy tools, and they can sometimes be found in hardware stores as well.</p>

                        <p className="text-muted">A flowerpot, flower pot, planter, planterette, or alternatively plant pot is a container in which flowers and other plants are cultivated and displayed. Historically, and still to a significant extent today, they are made from plain terracotta with no ceramic glaze, with a round shape, tapering inwards. Flowerpots are now often also made from plastic, metal, wood, stone, or sometimes biodegradable material. An example of biodegradable pots are ones made of heavy brown paper, cardboard, or peat moss in which young plants for transplanting are grown.</p>

                        <p className="text-muted">A watering can (or watering pot) is a portable container, usually with a handle and a funnel, used to water plants by hand. It has been in use since at least A.D. 79 and has since seen many improvements in design. Apart from watering plants, it has varied uses, as it is a fairly versatile tool.The capacity of the container can be anywhere from 0.5 litres (for indoor household plants) to 10 litres (for general garden use). It is usually made of metal, ceramic or plastic. At the end of the spout, a "rose" (a device, like a cap, with small holes) can be placed to break up the stream of water into droplets, to avoid excessive water pressure on the soil or on delicate plants.</p>
